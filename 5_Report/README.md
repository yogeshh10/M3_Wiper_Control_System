# **WIPER CONTROL SYSTEM**
A wiper is an important part of a car that cleans the windshield of raindrops or other liquids. Before, you had to manually turn on the wipers by changing the frequency. As a result, there are different ways to speed up the wipers. The goal of the project is to improve the systems of old cars by giving them automatic transmission. wiping system, to improve the system by adding a sensor and actuator, and to make a simple piece of software that would work with the system as a whole. how things work The idea behind this proposed wiper system is similar to that of regular wipers that are already on the market. In spite of the fact. This system will be changed so that it can clean the windshield automatically using a Peripheral Interface.

## **REQUIREMENTS**
---
## **INTRODUCTION**
With a wiper control system, the normal wiper blade is replaced by an electrical part. In this setup, a single switch in the ACC position will control the ignition button on the motor. With a second press, you can turn on the wipers. With a third press, you can change how fast the wipers move. With a fourth press, you can turn off the motor. LEDs and a simulation tool were used to do all of this. A wiper is an important part of a car that clears the windshield of rain or other liquids. Before, you had to turn on the wipers by hand, and it was hard to get the wipers up. So, this system is being offered as a way to solve all of these problems. The project's goals are to make wiper systems for older cars, improve the system with actuators and pull switches (using the same switch for different functions by switching in steps), and use a single switch to control both the engine speed and the speed of the wipers. This system controls how fast the wipers work based on how much rain there is. This Wiper Speed Control System is used in all kinds of cars, and its main job is to clear raindrops from the front windshield.

## **Identifying features**
- It shall print ignition of the car when Button is pressed ONCE.
- It shall print wiper should on at a slow speed (1Hz) when Button is pressed TWICE.
- It shall print wiper should work at a speed of medium (4Hz) when the Button is pressed THREE times.
- It shall print wiper should work at the maximum speed (8Hz) when the Button is pressed FOUR times.
- It shall print ignition should off when button is pressed FIVE times.

## **AIM**
- To make sure drivers have the best view for safety.
- To get rid of rain drops, snow, and other things that are wedged on the windshield.
- Getting clear visibility when the weather is bad.
- Using a modern mechanism to make sure safety.

## **SOFTWARE USED**
- STM32 CUBE IDE

## **HIGH LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
- System shall display Ignition status of the car.
- System shall display Viper State-1 of the car.
- System shall display Viper State-2 of the car.
- System shall display Viper State-3 of the car.

## **LOW LEVEL REQUIREMENTS**
- According to the press of Button for 2 seconds, Ignition LED_RED shall be ON.
- According to the press of Button for 2 seconds, Ignition LED_RED shall be OFF.
- According to the press of Button all LED's shall be on in alternate fashion in Frequency(1Hz) indicating Viper movement.
- According to the press of Button all LED's shall be on in alternate fashion in Frequency(4Hz) indicating Viper movement.

## **SWOT ANALYSIS**
### **Strength**
- Clear visibility.
- We can control the wiper speed using just one button.
- It consumes less power for operation.
- Installation of rain sensor based systems are very much simple.

### **Weakness**
- Replacement of wiper is required.
- The rain sensor based system functions when water falls on the sensor directly.
- Wiper motor problems.

### **Opportunities**
- Wide Scope in the Future of Automobiles Viper Managemnet and Control System.
- Emerging new market.

### **Threat**
- In the rain, wiper blend could be a problem.
- Replaced by modern technology.

## **5W's and 1H**
### **WHO**
- Everyone who needs to drive safely and with a clear view of the road.

### **WHERE**
- Anywhere the user wants to use the feautures provided.

### **WHAT**
- Wiper Control System (WCS) for vehicles.

### **WHY**
- Switching between controls and wipers is simple.

### **WHEN**
- In difficult environmental conditions, such as a rainy climate.

### **HOW**
- Through a Simple and single Button and after wiping the windsheet of motor vehicles, the LED displays the position of the wiper and returns to its normal state.
